# Overview #

The project contains implementation of prediction algorithms that when combined together acheive a 0.8988 RMSE score on the probe set.

Please notice that In order to run the classes you'll need a 64bit OS with at least 4GB RAM (we used windows XP 64bit) and a 64bit JDK/JRE 1.6 or above (we used JDK 1.6 64bit).
In addition, we recommend using [eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) for running/viewing the code (we used eclipse 3.4).
